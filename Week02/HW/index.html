            <h3>How to Store Dango:</h3>
            You can store this easy Hanami Dango in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. A cool

            <h3>Lets Get Started!</h3>

            <ol>
                <li> Before you get started on the dango, you’ll need to soak 12 small bamboo skewers in water.</li>
                <li> Add 150 grams of non-glutinous rice flour (joshinko) into a bowl, along with 200 grams glutinous
                    sweet
                    rice flour (shiratamako). You can also add 75 grams of powdered sugar to make the dango sweeter if
                    you
                    want! </li>
                <li> Pour in 1 1/3 cup hot water. Begin mixing using a spoon. Once the mixture begins to take shape, use
                    your hands to mold the dango dough together. You may need to add a little more flour or water to get
                    the
                    correct consistency; The dough should feel similar to clay or play-dough, only a bit softer.</li>
                <li> Now, evenly divide the dough into three separate pieces. Place the dough pieces into 3 separate
                    bowls.
                    Add 1 drop of pink food coloring into one piece and work it in. </li>
                <li>The second piece of dough will be matcha. You’ll need to add 1 teaspoon of water to 1 teaspoon of
                    match
                    powder to make a paste. Then add the matcha paste to that dough and work it in.</li>
                <li>The third piece of dough will remain white, so you do not need to add anything to it.</li>
                <li>Now shape the dough into round balls. Each ball should be 20 grams. It’s best to use a kitchen scale
                    when measuring out the weight of the dough. This recipe should make about 36 balls.</li>
                <li>Now bring a pot of water to a boil and begin cooking the white dango balls first. Once you see the
                    balls
                    rise to the top of the pot, continue cooking for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Then use a slotted spoon to transfer the steamed dango and quickly place it into a bowl of ice
                    water.
                </li>
                <li>Continue doing this for the pink dango and then the green dango last. You want to cook in this order
                    to
                    avoid staining the water and changing the color of the dango.</li>
                <li> Now you can skewer the dango onto the bamboo skewers. Always insert the green ones first, then the
                    white ones in the middle, and the pink ones last. The pink symbolizes spring cherry blossoms, white
                    represents winter snow, and green represents summer grass. They are typically eaten during spring
                    cherry
                    blossom season. You can eat them as they are or add toppings like sweet soy glaze, red bean paste,
                    or
                    matcha paste!</li>
